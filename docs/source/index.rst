Welcome to pumml's documentation!
=================================

Positive and Unlabeled Materials Machine Learning (pumml) is a code that uses
semi-supervised positive and unlabeled (PU) machine learning to classify
materials when data is incomplete and only examples of "positive" materials
are available.
